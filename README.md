Developed Embedded C code and made the hardware connection on proteus software. In which used
16x2 LCD and 4x4 keypad to enter password, AT89C51 microcontroller(8051-family).

I set the 4-digit predefined password. If user entered password is matched with the predefined password then device will unlock and display the right password on the LCD.

If entered password is not matched with predefined password then device will not unlock and display the wrong password on LCD.

If attempt of wrong password is equal to two .In this case device will lock for 30 second.
